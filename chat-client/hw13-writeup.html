		<h1>Final Chat App HW13</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Problem:</b> Many people who make plans to go somewhere 
                often have to exit out of the chat to search for the
                location on Google Maps. This is inconvenient and
                disrupts the flow of the conversation. When they 
                find the place, they either need to screenshot and 
                send it to the chat or they tell the friend the place 
                and then they need to look up the location themselves.
                This makes it annoying to make plans or discover new places 
                to eat, shop, or explore.

            <li><b>How my design addresses this problem: </b>
                My design centers around sharing locations in the chat. 
                If you type in the location input, there will be a dropdown
                menu of autocomplete suggestions from Google Maps. This ensures 
                that you are searching for the intended location and in the 
                correct format. When you send the location, an interactive embedded maps 
                of the location will be displayed in the chat. You can scroll, zoom in,
                and explore the area around the location. I accomplished this with the 
                Google Maps autocomplete API and the Google Maps Embed API. Additionally,
                the location sent in the chat is also a clickable link that takes you directly 
                to the place on Google Maps. There is also a Maps icon next to the location 
                input that takes you to Google Maps for a standard search. Finally, there 
                is a clickable list of the recent locations mentioned in the chat. This makes
                finding places extremely easy and displays everything in the chat with additional 
                options to take you directly to Google Maps.
