		<h1>Customized Prototype Writeup</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Ultimately, I plan to turn in a design that centers 
                around sharing locations: an embedded Google Maps 
                that will take you there, an input for a location 
                in your message that automatically performs 
                that search when clicked, a display of the location on the Map in chat, 
                and a clickable list of the recent locations mentioned in the chat. 
            </li>
            <li>
                At the core, it is similar to my Figma mockup (generic embedded Maps search 
                and automatic specific location search), but it includes a separate
                input for the location instead of making every message queryable. This makes it 
                more intuitive, safer, and easier to discover for the user. I also decided to include a list of 
                recent locations mentioned in the chat for users to easily scan through and click on.
            </li>
            <li>
                This week, I have completed the Google Maps icon generic search, the location input that 
                automatically takes you there on Google Maps, and the clickable list of recent locations. 
                I manually added the embedded maps for a few locations to be displayed in the chat for a proof 
                of concept (try typing in cupertino, jonquils, stata, or mit in the location input). This is 
                an appropriate halfway point because I have the basic functionalities and proof of concept working.
                Next week, I plan to try and utilize the embedded 
                Google Maps API so it works for any location (and not just the hard-coded ones).
