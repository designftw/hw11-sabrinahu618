		<h2>Add read indicators</h2>
		<p>
			The read indicator automatically adds the user's username 
			if they read the message. It shows the number of people who 
			have read the message, and if you hover over it, it would display 
			a list of all the usernames who have read the message. The hover 
			feature is so that the chat doesn't get cluttered with usernames.
		</p>

		<h2>Add a reply feature to messages</h2>
		<p>
			There is a reply text attached to each message that 
			users can use to reply to the specific message and it 
			displays underneath. It shows the number of replies 
			a message has, and you can click the drop down to see 
			all of the replies. This is to avoid clutter and a really 
			long message chain if there are a lot of replies.
		</p>

		<h2>Profile Picture</h2>
		<p>
			Users can click edit profile picture to upload a profile picture, 
			and after clicking save, it will display their profile picture 
			at the top and in all of their messages. If other users also 
			have a profile picture, it will also display.
